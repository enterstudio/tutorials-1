Enter your Lavabit email address and password in the `Email address` and `Password` fields. In the
`Send your messages using this name` field, enter the name you would like to have displayed to your recipients.
You will most likely use your full name but you are free to enter anything you wish such as your company name
or a short description of the account if it serves a special purpose.

Finally click `Sign in`. Mail will detect the rest of the settings for you.

Inbox. You can also try sending an e-mail to make sure your outgoing mail works as well.
