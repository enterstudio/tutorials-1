To add a new account to an existing Thunderbird installation, select the `Edit` > `Account Settings` option, then
select `Account Actions` > `Add Mail Account` at the bottom left. If youâ€™re starting Evolution for the first time,
it will automatically display the new account setup prompt.

# Step Two

In the `Your name` field, enter the name you would like to have displayed to your recipients. You will most likely
use your full name but you are free to enter anything you wish such as your company name or a short description of the
account if it serves a special purpose.

Enter your Lavabit email address and password in the `Email address` and `Password` fields, then click `Continue`.

# Step Three

After Thunderbird searches for settings, the prompt will expand to show more options. Choose between POP3 or IMAP,
select either STARTTLS or SSL or security (they both offer the same level), and let Thunderbird choose the port for
you.

Finally, click `Re-test` and then `Done`.

After Thunderbird syncs with the mail server, you should see a message from the Lavabit Support Team in your Inbox.
You can also try sending an e-mail to make sure your outgoing mail works as well.

For most users, this is the happy ending to the story. If you hit a snag, please email us at support@lavabit.com
