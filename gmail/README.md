Finally, enter an account name and in the `Your name` field, enter the name you would like to have displayed to your
recipients. You will most likely use your full name but you are free to enter anything you wish such as your company
name or a short description of the account if it serves a special purpose.

Finally, tap `Done`. After Gmail syncs with the mail server, you should see a message from the Lavabit Support Team in =
your Inbox. You can also try sending an e-mail to make sure your outgoing mail works as well.

For most users, this is the happy ending to the story. If you hit a snag, please email us at support@lavabit.com
