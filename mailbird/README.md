In the `Your name` field, enter the name you would like to have displayed to your recipients. You will most
likely use your full name but you are free to enter anything you wish such as your company name or a short
description of the account if it serves a special purpose.

In the `E-mail` and field, enter your Lavabit password. Click `Continue`.

# Step Three

Continue through the prompts until Mailbird finds the settings automatically. Enter your Lavabit password
and click `Continue`.

After Mailbird syncs with the mail server, you should see a message from the Lavabit Support Team in your Inbox.
You can also try sending an e-mail to make sure your outgoing mail works as well.

For most users, this is the happy ending to the story. If you hit a snag, please email us at support@lavabit.com
