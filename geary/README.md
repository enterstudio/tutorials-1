# Step One

To add a new account to an existing Geary installation, click the file icon in the top left, click `Accounts`,
then click the plus sign button. If youâ€™re starting Geary for the first time, it will automatically display the
new account setup prompt.

First, select `Other` at the top dropdown menu. Then in the name field, enter the name you would like to have
displayed to your recipients. You will most likely use your full name but you are free to enter anything you wish
such as your company name or a short description of the account if it serves a special purpose.

Fill out the IMAP and SMTP information, selecting either STARTTLS or SSL for security (they both provide the
same level) and let Geary choose the port number. You can check the box next to `Use IMAP credentials` to avoid
having to enter your Lavabit email address and password in twice.

Click `Add` when you are done filling out the form.

# Step Two

After Geary syncs with the mail server, you should see a message from the Lavabit Support Team in your Inbox.
You can also try sending an e-mail to make sure your outgoing mail works as well.

For most users, this is the happy ending to the story. If you hit a snag, please email us at support@lavabit.com
