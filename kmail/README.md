Fill out the POP3 or IMAP information. In the `Account Name` field, enter the name you would like to have displayed
to your recipients. You will most likely use your full name but you are free to enter anything you wish such as your
company name or a short description of the account if it serves a special purpose.

In the `Username` and `Password` fields, enter your Lavabit email address and password.

# Step Five

You can also try sending an e-mail to make sure your outgoing mail works as well.
