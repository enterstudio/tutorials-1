In the `Create a new Account` modal, first enter the name you would like to have displayed to your recipients in
the `Name` field. You will most likely use your full name but you are free to enter anything you wish such as your
company name or a short description of the account if it serves a special purpose.

Enter your Lavabit email address and password in the `E-mail` and `Password` fields, then click `Next`.

After Mailpile syncs with the mail server, you should see a message from the Lavabit Support Team in your Inbox.
You can also try sending an e-mail to make sure your outgoing mail works as well.

For most users, this is the happy ending to the story. If you hit a snag, please email us at support@lavabit.com
